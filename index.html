                        <p>The cycling culture in Denmark is almost as old as the bicycle itself. Bikes were first introduced to the country in the 1880s and during the 1920s and 1930s, the bicycle became a symbol of equality and freedom. People of all social classes began biking side by side on their way to work, to a bar, or just the countryside on their days off.
                            As cars became more affordable, there was a period during the 50s and 60s, where the number of bicycle riders declined. A Strøget, the main shopping street in Copenhagen, became pedestrian only in 1962 and in the 70s, ‘Car Free Sundays’ were introduced in Copenhagen, and there were protests demanding that all of Copenhagen became car-free.

                        <p>In our time, where the threat of global warming is ever-present, sustainable modes of transportation are at the forefront of solutions necessary to curb excess emissions.</p>

                            <h2 class="tm-section-title tm-blue-text">The dataset</h2>
                            <p>Our main dataset is bicycle data from various measuring points throughout the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area, between the years 2005 – 2014.
                                The measurements seem to have been usually conducted mostly on the same streets each year. They started by testing a few streets and kept adding locations, until eventually they gradually stopped measuring them once they retrieved the necessary data. This observation is important when we are going to look into patterns on a yearly basis - we have to consider the number of conducted experiments that year and average upon that.</p>
                            <p>Having gathered all the bike data, done the initial exploration and cleaning on the complete data set, In total, we ended up have 92090 bike data points, with 31 features each. We are now ready to get on our bikes and begin our journey!</p>
                            <h3>Interesting fact about the data</h3>

                                    <p class="tm-small-font">Data exploration revealed a very interesting pattern. In most years, all of the roads seemed to have missing values about day 90 and 300 of each year (i.e. around the end of March and end October). This is in order to handle the transition to summer time and back!</p>

                        <h2 class="tm-green-text tm-section-title">Temporal Patterns</h2>
                        <p>In this first part, we'll begin by looking into the <b>temporal patterns</b> of the data in order to confirm or reject our initial assumpltions and expectations, such as:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Weekdays busiest hours, will be 7am - 9am.</li>
                                <li>Friday nights will be busier than usual.</li>
                                <li>Traffic will be towards the city in the above cases.</li>
                                <li>People ride less during the winter.</li>
                                <li>Bicycle users' number has increased over time.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the plot to the right, we can see that Monday-Friday have similar hourly patterns, with large peaks in the morning and afternoon. These patterns are not appearent in the weekends, which implies that these spikes originate from people traveling to work, school, etc. 
                        One interesting observation is that on Friday afternoons, there is a slight change to the pattern, which indicates that people probably stay for a beer at the company's Friday bar!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tm-textbox-wide tm-white-bg">
                        <!-- Bokeh-->
                        <div class="bk-root" id="a2f53689-76a3-40db-aa3d-f4f3c92e6ef5" data-root-id="1835"></div><br>
                        <p>In the Bokeh plot above, we see the average number of bicycles per hour of the day. There are three viewing options, by selecting from the RGB boxes in order to view the cyclists going towards the city, those going away from it and the total.
                            Selecting just the 'Total', we see the same pattern as in the previous plot. Things become more interesting, if we toggle either 'Away from city' or 'Towards city'. We then see similar patterns to the total distribution, which <b>was not what we expected!</b>
                            For example, we saw that Dronnings Louises Bro had a quite salient pattern when inspecting a single direction. This could imply that the direction people primarily go (towards or away from the city), is very dependent <b>on the specific location</b>.

                        <p>For this we looked at <b>Hareskovvej</b>, as it's the only one from the streets that became a super bike lane during the years we have data for. The rest were delivered at a later time, most of them in 2017.</p>
                        <p>In the figure on the bottom-right, we plot the "fair comparisons" based on equal number of days on the left side and the possibly biased (in both directions) on the right side.
                            Every point is the average number of cyclists in the specified month. Each point on that same month (vertically) refers to the different years. The dots are colored blue if they are prior to April 2013 and red if they are after it.</p>
                        <p> We can then observe that more bicyclists passed on Hareskovvej at every month and year after the opening of the super bike lane, as every red point is higher up than the blue ones. <b style="color:#0056c7;">This implies that the super bike lanes do have an impact on the number of people who choose to use their bicycle!</b></p>

                            <h3>Influence of Super Bike Lanes</h3>
                            <p>A pessimistic prediction would be that we see an 23% increase in the number of bicyclists on Hareskovvej, after it was introduced as a super bike lane. Note that this "pessimistic" prediction is much higher than the yearly increase in Copenhagen's population since 2005 (≈2%). At the same time, it is also higher than the general increase of cyclists on the streets since 2005 (≈17%). 
                                A more accuracte prediction would probably be to compute the increase of the average number of cyclists before and after April 2013 on Hareskovvej which is: <i>≈1.60968</i></p>
                            <p>This shows that from the data, we can observe that 61% more people on average for the selected four months, ride on Hareskovvej after it's upgrade to "super". This fits very well with other analyses done on the specific location. Newer analyses with data up to 2018, show an increase of 68% on weekdays and 108% during the weekends. 
                                Furthermore, it is also worth-mentioning that our work suggest that the government's goal of a 25% increase on the number of cyclists on this super bike lane has been reached!<br><b style="color:#0056c7;">This was said to save 230 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> and 10.1 million DKK, as gain in healthcare economics.</b></p>
